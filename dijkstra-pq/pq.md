Problem 10.8 Implement in your favorite programming language the heap-based version of the Dijkstra algorithm from Section 10.4, and use it to solve the single-source shortest path problem in diﬀerent directed graphs. With this heap-based implementation, what’s the size of the largest problem you can solve in ﬁve minutes or less? (See www.algorithmsilluminated.org for test cases and challenge data sets.)

[Hint: This requires the Delete operation, which may force you to implement a customized heap data structure from scratch. To delete an object from a heap at a given position, follow the high-level approach of Insert and ExtractMin, using Bubble-Up or Bubble-Down as needed to squash violations of the heap property. You will also need to keep track of which vertex is in which position of your heap, perhaps by using a hash table (Chapter 12).]
