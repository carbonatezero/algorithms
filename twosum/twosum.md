Problem 12.4 Implement in your favorite programming language the hash table-based solution to the 2-SUM problem in Section 12.2.2. For example, you could generate a list S of one million random integers between -10^11 and 10^11 , and count the number of targets t between -10000 and 10000 for which there are distinct x, y \in S with x+y = t.

You can use existing implementations of hash tables, or you can implement your own from scratch. In the latter case, compare your performance under diï¬€erent collision-resolution strategies, such as chaining vs. linear probing.
